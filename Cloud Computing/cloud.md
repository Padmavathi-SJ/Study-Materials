### Introduction to Cloud Computing
### Why we moved to cloud
### Cloud Service Models
* Iaas
* Paas
* Saas
1.Saas(Software as a Service):
  * Cloud provider leases applications or softwares which are owned by them to its client.
  * Example: Gmail--> In gmail we are only using the services. other than that the security the trobleshooting, all are managed by Google managers only.
  * Here we are using that rendered software alone(gmail)

2. Paas(Platform as a Service):
   * No need to control or maintain OS, Storage, servers etc..
   * The cloud provider gives the abiloty to the customer to deploy customer created app using programming languages, tools etc that are provided by the cloud provider.
   * Example: Google App Engine: Here we can develop our application and deploy also in Google App itself, then anyone can use it.
   * So here, We got a platform to develop and deploy our applications.


3. IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service):
    * Provides a platform allowing developers to build, run and manage applications without the complexity of infratructure management. It offers development environment with tools, libraries, and services. 
    * Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    * No worries about the underlying physical machine
    * We can choose which OS we want, and which platform we want and etc..
    * Example: Heroku, is a popular PaaS provider that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications iwthout worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    * Developers push their code to Heroku via Git. Heroku handles the rest, such as setting up the environment, managing database, scaling, and monitoring the app.
    * Our work is focusing on development alone, the rest will be focused and handled by Heroku.
  
  ### SaaS:
  * we manage: Data
  * Managed by vendor: Applications, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

  ### PaaS:
  * We manage: Data, Applications
  * Managed by Vendor: Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

  ### IaaS:
  * We manage: Data , Applications, Runtime, Middleware, O/S.
  * Managed by vendor: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

## Deployment Models:
1. Public cloud
2. Private cloud
3. Hybrid cloud
