# Docker Containers:

## What is container:
* A unit of software and deployment[code, Runtime, System tools, System libraries].

### why containers?
1. Move faster by deploying smaller units.
2. Use fewer resources.
3. Fit more into the same host.
4. Faster automation
5. Portability
6. Isolation
   
* Because it is faster to deploy something small than something big like a complete monolithic system.
* when using CI/CD techniques they are a lot faster to deploy.
* we can run hte anywhere.
* They are isolated each other, meaning that if one fails, it will not take the whole system down with it.

### What is virtualized?
1. Virtual Machines:
     * Large footprint
     * Slow to boot
     * Ideal for long running tasks
2. Container
     * Lightweight
     * Quick to start(it does not have to boot)
     * Portable
     * Ideal for short lived taskes
* Our containers replacing Virtual Machines.
