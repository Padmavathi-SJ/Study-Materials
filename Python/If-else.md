### 01. print a statement

```
print("Hello Mummy!")
```
### 02. if condition:
```
if 5>2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
```
### 03. two if conditions:
```
if 5>2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
if 2<5:
    print("two is less than five!")
```
### 04. 
**In python no need to declare a variable**
```
x=5
y="Hello, Mummy!"
```
## Variables:
```
x=100
y="Kavi"
print(x)
print(y)
```
**Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set**
```
x=100
x="Padma"
x=500
print(x)
```
* output: 500

**If we want to specify the data type of a variabke, this can be done with typecasting**

```
x=str(3) # x will be 3
x=int(3) # x will be 3
x=float(3) # x wil be 3.0
```
* We can get the data type of a varibale with the "type()" function
```
x=5
y="Padma"
z=3.0
print(type(x)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'str'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'float'>
```
* String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
```
x="padma"
y='mummy'
print(x) # Padma
print(y) # Mummy
```
